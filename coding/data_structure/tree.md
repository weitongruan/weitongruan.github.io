### 96 Unique Binary Search Trees

#### General idea:

Let's first take a look at a few examples:

- n = 1: definitely return 1

- n = 2: we have 2 nodes (1 or 2) that can be placed as root, once we pick one as root, the other either becomes its left child or right child, and the other child is **None**. This gives us: 

$$ 1*1 + 1*1 = 2 $$

- n = 3: again, we have 3 nodes that can be chosen as root:
    * If we pick 1 as root, we leave **None** as its **left** child and $$\{2, 3\}$$ as its **right** subtree, from the previous case where n = 2, we know we can have 2 unique subtree, so in this case, the unique number of BSTs is:
    $$ 1*2 = 2 $$
    
    * If we pick 2 as root, we leave $$1$$ as **left** subtree and $$3$$ as **right** subtree, it's obvious that here the unique number of BSTs is:
    $$ 1*1 = 1 $$
    
    * If we pick 3 as root, this case will be just the same as if we pick 1, because of symmetry. Again, in this case, we have 2 more unique BSTs:
    $$ 2*1 = 1 $$
    In this case, we should return:
    
$$ 1*2 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 5 $$

**We notice here that: first, due to the BST condition, the ordering doesn't matter, only the number of nodes in a tree matters; second, the result is a summation of possible unique BSTs from $$n$$ cases, where for each case, the possible unique BSTs is a product of that of the left subtree and that of the right subtree**

#### Codes

Now, we almost have the algorithm, if written in a recursive way, it looks like:

```python
def numTrees(n):
    # base case
    if n == 0 : return 1
    
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += numTrees(i) * numTrees(n-1-i)
        
    return res
```

This recursive algorithm falls in the very common case where it can be improved by dynamic programming due to tons of repeated calculations.

```python
def numTrees(n):
    dp = [1]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        dp.append(sum([dp[j]*dp[i-1-j] for j in range(i)]))
    
    return dp[-1]
```

One simple improvements we can make it to take advantage of the symmetry property, i.e. instead of letting the second loop to go from $$0$$ to $$i$$, let it stop at $$i//2$$, double the sum and plus an extra term (dp[ $$i//2$$ ]) if $$i$$ is an odd number. However, I'm not sure if this would speed it up, I guess it helps when n is large.

```python
    def numTrees(n):
    dp = [1]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        dp.append(2*sum(dp[j]*dp[i-1-j] for j in range(i//2+1)))
        if n % 2:
            dp[-1] -= dp[i//2]**2
        # if n % 2:
        #     dp.append(2*sum([dp[j]*dp[i-1-j] for j in range(i//2)])+dp[i//2]**2)
        # else:
        #     dp.append(2*sum(dp[j]*dp[i-1-j] for j in range(i//2+1)))
```

#### Take aways:

When the keys to a hash table (dictionary) is integers (0-N), we can simply use a array(list) to achieve the same functionality.

### 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

#### General Idea:
One of the features of Binary Search Tree is that when you use in order depth first traversal, the value of each node is goint to appear in increasing(non-decreasing) order or sorted order.

For example, as in this form:

```math
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

When two are accidentally swapped, it would result in a new list, such as:

```math
1, 2, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 9 ,10
```

so what we can do here is to find the two wrong nodes and swap them back.

One way to find those two, is to use a pointer "**prev**" that points to the previous node and compare the value of the current node with that of the previous one. The special cases that we are looking for is:


```text
node.val < prev.val
```

For the first swapped node, the node in the wrong position  should be **prev**, while for the second, it should be the **node**.

Up to here, we almost have a general idea of what this algorithm should look like. It will perform an **in-order traversal** of the tree, which takes **O(n)** time. In terms of space, because of the recursive call, itâ€™s **O(n)**.

***
#### Corner cases:

Need to pay attention to the case where the swapped nodes are next to each other.

***
#### Codes:

Basics of TreeNode class:
```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

```

My first iterative algorithm looks like:

```python

class Solution(object):
    def recoverTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return root
        
        def dfs_inorder(node):
            wrong = []
            stack = []
            prev = TreeNode(-float('inf'))
            flag = False
            while stack or node:
                if node:
                    stack.append(node)
                    node = node.left
                else:
                    node = stack.pop()
                    if not flag and node.val < prev.val:
                        wrong.append(prev)
                        wrong.append(node)
                        flag = True
                    elif flag and node.val < prev.val:
                        wrong.pop()
                        wrong.append(node)
                        return wrong
                    prev = node
                    node = node.right
            return wrong
                    
        wrong_nodes = dfs_inorder(root)
        wrong_nodes[0].val, wrong_nodes[1].val = wrong_nodes[1].val, wrong_nodes[0].val
        
```

It can be easily improved to this, getting rid of the flag:

```python

class Solution(object):
    def recoverTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        
        def dfs_inorder(node):
            first, second = None, None
            stack = []
            prev = TreeNode(-int('inf'))
            while stack or node:
                if node:
                    stack.append(node)
                    node = node.left
                else:
                    node = stack.pop()
                    if not first and node.val < prev.val:
                        first, second = prev, node
                    elif first and node.val < prev.val:
                        second = node
                        return (first, second)
                    prev, node = node, node.right
            return (first, second)
                    
        wrong_nodes = dfs_inorder(root)
        wrong_nodes[0].val, wrong_nodes[1].val = wrong_nodes[1].val, wrong_nodes[0].val
        
```

For a recursive algorithm:

(Note: we make first and second and pre a list is to make them mutable)

```python

class Solution(object):
    def recoverTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        
        first, second = [], [None]
        pre = [TreeNode(-float('inf'))]
        
        def dfs_inorder(node):

            if not node:
                return
            
            dfs_inorder(node.left)
            
            if not len(first) and node.val < pre[0].val:
                first.append(pre[0])
            if len(first) and node.val < pre[0].val:
                second[0] = node
            
            pre[0] = node
                
            dfs_inorder(node.right)
            return
              
        dfs_inorder(root)
        first[0].val, second[0].val = second[0].val, first[0].val
```
