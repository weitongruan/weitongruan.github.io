### Combination Problems

In one of the previous posts, we looked at [combination sum problems](http://weitongruan.github.io/coding/algorithms/combination_sum_problems), where ***backtracking*** proves to be extremely useful. In this post, I want to talk about the more general ***Combination Problem***, which is a constrained optimization problem but not easily solved numerically.

***For combination problems, if detailed combination is required, backtracking is preferred, if only the total number of combination is needed, we can try to think of other faster ways.***
